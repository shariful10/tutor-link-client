          <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-800">
            At TutorsyncX, we believe that every student deserves a personal
            tutor, and we are dedicated to promoting equity, opportunity, and
            achievement for all learners. To that end, we partner with colleges
            and universities, K‚Äì12 schools and districts, public and state
            libraries, employee benefits programs, and various organizations to
            provide 24/7, on-demand tutoring and homework help in more than 250
            subjects. Our mission is to instill hope, advance equity, and
            catalyze achievement in schools and communities. We do this by
            providing encouraging, empowering, and effective academic and
            professional support for learners of all ages and stages‚Äîfrom
            kindergarten through college, graduate school, career, and
            continuing education. Over more than two decades of supporting
            students, educators, school leaders, and families, we have helped
            institutions increase student success and retention rates, and
            learners become more confident in their studies. Our learner
            satisfaction rates remain consistently high: 97% of post-session
            survey respondents would recommend TutorsyncX to a friend, and 98%
            are glad their institution offers TutorsyncX. The feeling is mutual.
            We are honored to partner with institutions and organizations to
            help them scale the human connection and provide personalized
            support‚Äîanytime, anywhere.
